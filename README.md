# MIDIgen

### Refocus
---
Refocus of this project to use a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a camera to take pictures and generate midi output from those images. Research will stay in project but the main focus of the project is changed. 

### Roadmap 
---
 Generate an array based on notes in scale
- [ ] Snap to Key
- [ ] RPI camera module
- [ ] Image Color Look up 
- [ ] Ever changing image every step (take picture between notes)
- [ ] Midi Not Output



#### "To-Do" Break Down

- [x] Randomly select root note
- [x] Generate a scale array to use for note looking (snap to key/scale)
  - [ ] Refactor for loop into a while true loop (cleaner)
- [ ] Randomly select scale (From an Array of Scales)



### Install instructions

The planning process of project is underway so there is no path yet into what will be required to run this code. It will be based around Python3
